 'text_content': u'WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday announced a gun control task force led by Vice President Joe Biden. The inter-agency task force is charged with guiding the administration\'s continuing response to calls of gun control after the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre.\n\n\n\nObama made the announcement at the White House briefing room with Biden standing at his side. He said although conversation about stopping future shooting incidents has to continue, "words need to lead to action."\n\n\n\n"The fact this problem is complex can no longer be excuse" for delaying action, said Obama, reiterating his pledge that he would "use all the powers of this office to help advance efforts aimed at preventing more tragedies like this."\n\n\n\nNoting no single law or set of laws can prevent more gun violence, Obama stressed the importance of taking a holistic approach on the problem, including education and care for mental issues.\n\n\n\nObama promised the task force would make proposals for new laws and actions in January, and he would push the new gun control proposals in Congress.\n\n\n\n"This is not some Washington commission" that will take six months and be shelved, Obama said of the effort to be spearheaded by Biden, a longtime gun control advocate who had spent decades in Congress.\n\n\n\nIn the first steps the administration takes after the Newtown tragedy, Biden will work with cabinet members and outside groups to formulate the recommendations, as the president called on Congress to reinstate an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 and to pass legislation that would close the gun show loophole, which allows people to purchase firearms without a background check.\n\n\n\nA gunman stormed Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtwon Friday, killing 20 kids and 6 adults, after killing his own mother at her residence. He committed suicide after the horrific shooting rampage. \n\n\n\n',

 'text_content': u"In November, 2012 Astana, capital of Kazakhstan was selected to host the International Expo in 2017 . It will be Kazakhstan's first world's fair as well as the first in Central Asia. The celebration of the Expo 2017 will highlight the awareness of the central Asia as well as promote the economic development of Kazakhstan and the region. It will have a long time economic effect, said the Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan Erlan Idrisov in an interview with reporter from People\u2019s Daily Online.\n\n\n\nKazakhstan was voted to host Expo 2017 after fierce competition.\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 22, Kazakhstan was competing with Belgium over who will hold the 2017 Expo. We had a very difficult competition with the well-developed western country, Belgium, the capital of European Union. We are a young country competing with such powerful competitor, but we are successful. \n\n\n\n161 countries are voting at the international exhibition bureau, we got 103 votes while Belgium got 44. We won by a large majority, we are very proud of this. \n\n\n\nKazakhstan based its bid on a number of pillars.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, the logo and topic of our exhibition of 2017 is the energy of the future, so it is about new approach to economic growth, new source of energy, new approach to ensure global economy and entire change of running your life. This is the topic we have chosen. \n\n\n\nSecondly, we place our bid on promote our part of the world for more than 300 years; this part of world is behind the wall, to the east and to the west. No information was available to the world about this part of the world. Historically, this is one of the most important parts of the world, through which east and west can have economic communication, so our second pillar is to highlight and promote the awareness of the central Asia. \n\n\n\nBy bringing international exposure to Expo 2017, the international attention comes to this part of the world. It is important to engage with more economic opportunities, like Silk Road, the engaging with silk roads can bring so many benefits. In this case, we create an economic bridge. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n",

He underwent a successful surgery to have the gallstones removed last week after doctors attended to his lung infection. He remains under medical care in a Pretoria hospital and is recovering, according to the Presidency.\n\n\n\n"If he spends more days in hospital, it is because that necessary care is being provided. We wish the family strength during this period. They have the love and support of the whole nation," Zuma said.\n\n\n\nWhile once again urging the public to continue supporting Mandela, Zuma said the public should understand that Mandela is 94 years old and needs extra-ordinary care.\n\n\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Presidential Spokesperson Mr. Mac Maharaj went to see Mandela. "He is looking much better," said Maharaj.\n\n\n\nMandela\'s health has been a focus of concern. His hospital stay this time is his longest since 2001, when he underwent seven weeks of radiotherapy after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\n\n\nIn January 2011, Mandela was admitted to a Johannesburg hospital for an acute respiratory infection for a short period. In February this year, he spent a night in a hospital for a minor diagnostic surgery to determine the cause of an abdominal complain.\n\n\n\nMandela, who was imprisoned for 27 years during apartheid, was elected the country\'s first black president in 1994. \n\n\n\n\n\n',

 'text_content': u'WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Barack Obama would veto the House Speaker John Boehner\'s "Plan B" proposal on " fiscal cliff", a combination of tax increases and spending cuts due on Jan. 1, 2013, the White House said Wednesday.\n\n\n\n"This approach does not meet the test of balance, and the President would veto the legislation in the unlikely event of its passage," White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said in a statement. "The President urges the Republican leadership to work with us to resolve remaining differences and find a reasonable solution to this situation today."\n\n\n\nBoehner said on Tuesday that he would move to "Plan B", a proposal for avoiding the looming fiscal woes if his attempts to forge a broader deal with the White House fail. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives could vote on Thursday on the bill.\n\n\n\nAccording to the primary estimate of the White House, the backup plan Boehner proposed Tuesday would extend all of the Bush- era tax cuts -- including the reduced income tax rates and the lower dividend and capital gains rates -- on the first 1 million U. S. dollars of income and at the same time repeal tax expenditure limits even for households with incomes more than 1 million dollars.\n\n\n\nThe White House said that Boehner\' Plan B raises only about 300 billion dollars from the wealthiest, and the millionaires would get an average tax cut of 50,000 dollars.\n\n\n\nIn his latest offer, Obama said he would accept a deal that raise the threshold for tax hikes for a household\'s annual income to 400,000 dollars from 250,000 dollars he initially insisted.\n\n\n\nWithout a deal between the White House and Congress, all of the Bush-era tax rates will expire at the end of the year, and automatic tax increases and spending cuts are set to kick in. Economists have warned that the combination of tax hikes and spending cuts could drag the U.S. economy into recession.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n',

 'text_content': u'SEOUL, Dec. 19 (Xinhua) -- Park Geun-hye of South Korea\'s ruling Saenuri Party won the tightly contested presidential election held Wednesday, becoming the first woman to lead the country and extending the conservative rule for another five years.\n\n\n\nWith 94.5 percent of the votes counted, Park, the 60-year-old daughter of South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee, won 51.7 percent of the vote, becoming the first one to garner more than half of all votes since democratic elections began in 1987.\n\n\n\nHer archrival, Moon Jae-in of the main opposition Democratic United Party, was a close second with 47.9 percent.\n\n\n\nVoter turnout was estimated at 75.8 percent, the highest in 15 years, according to the National Election Commission.\n\n\n\n"I will become a president who puts people\'s livelihoods before anything else," Park told cheering crowds in central Seoul as she accepted her victory. "I will keep my promises."\n\n\n\nPark, who ran on job creation, welfare expansion and engagement with the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK), had maintained a slight lead in almost all pre-election opinion surveys, though many were within the margin of error.\n\n\n\nAs a political veteran with the moniker "queen of elections," Park acted as the de facto first lady to her father after her mother was assassinated and is credited with reviving the Saenuri Party when it was mired in a series of devastating corruption scandals.\n\n\n\nShe remains widely popular among older voters nostalgic for rapid economic growth under the senior Park\'s 18-year authoritarian rule, while critics point to ruthless suppression of dissidents during his reign.\n\n\n\nDespite dogged opposition criticism of Park for her reluctance to apologize for abuses under her father\'s watch, the five-term lawmaker proved yet again to be unassailable in key southern cities including her hometown of Deagu.\n\n\n\nMoon, a 59-year-old former human rights lawyer who was once jailed for protesting the senior Park\'s repressive rule, had billed the election as a contest between vested interests and aspirations for new politics.\n\n\n\n"I failed to keep the promise of an era of new politics," Moon said as he conceded defeat in a news conference at the campaign headquarters in Seoul. "I congratulate Park on her victory."\n\n\n\nMoon, former chief of staff to late ex-President Roh Moo-hyun, was the sole candidate running on the liberal ticket after independent Ahn Cheol-soo and leftist candidate Lee Jung-hee bowed out of the race to throw their support behind him.\n\n\n\nHe sought to make the election a judgment call on the unpopular incumbent Lee Myung-bak, but Park successfully distanced herself from the man who had defeated her in the party primary five years ago.\n\n\n\nLee\'s single five-year term ends early February, 2013.\n\n\n\n',

 'text_content': u'SEOUL, Dec. 19 (Xinhua) -- Polls opened early Wednesday morning in South Korea\'s closely contested presidential election, which pits the daughter of a military strongman against a former human rights lawyer once jailed for protesting his rule.\n\n\n\nVoting began at 6:00 a.m. local time at 13,542 polling stations nationwide, with more than 40.4 million eligible voters poised to cast their ballots. Polls close at 6:00 p.m., and the result is expected by midnight.\n\n\n\nOpinion surveys released last week showed Park Geun-hye of the conservative ruling Saenuri Party held a slight lead over her liberal rival, Moon Jae-in of the center-left main opposition Democratic United Party.\n\n\n\nStill, the gap in most polls was within the margin of error, and analysts say the contest is too close to call and its outcome will ultimately depend on voter turnout.\n\n\n\nPark, the 60-year-old daughter of South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee, is looking to become the first female leader of the country and extend the conservative rule for another five years.\n\n\n\n"I will restore the middle class and expand it to 70 percent of the country," Park said Tuesday during a press conference in her campaign headquarters in Seoul.\n\n\n\nPark, who acted as the de facto first lady to her father after her mother was assassinated, remains popular among older voters nostalgic for the rapid economic growth under the 18-year authoritarian rule.\n\n\n\nShe is an anathema, however, to former democracy activists such as Moon, who was jailed in 1975 for protesting against the late dictator.\n\n\n\nMoon, 59, is a former human rights lawyer who also served as chief of staff to late President Roh Moo-hyun. He believes that the election is a contest between vested interests and aspirations for new politics.\n\n\n\n"It has been proved that the Saenuri Party is incapable of representing the country," Moon said on the last day of campaigning.\n\n\n\nHe is the sole candidate running on the liberal ticket after independent Ahn Cheol-soo and leftist candidate Lee Jung-hee bowed out of the race to throw their support behind him.\n\n\n\nIncumbent President Lee Myung-bak, whose single five-year term ends early next year, is constitutionally barred from seeking re- election. \n\n\n\n',

 'text_content': u'WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 (Xinhua)-- U.S. House Speaker John Boehner said on Tuesday that he will move to a backup option for the fiscal woes due in January while remained hopeful a broader deal can be reached with the President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nBoehner spoke with reporters after a meeting with the Republican caucus to garner support for his recent offer for higher tax rates for households making over 1 million dollars a year.\n\n\n\n"Our hope continues to be to reach an agreement with the President on a balanced approach that averts the fiscal cliff. What we\'ve offered meets the definition of balance, but the President is not there yet," Boehner said.\n\n\n\nBoehner said the backup plan would extend low income tax rates for households with incomes below 1 million dollars a year.\n\n\n\n"I continue to have hope that we can reach a broader agreement with the White House that would reduce spending as well as have revenues on the table. I think it would be better for our country, " he noted.\n\n\n\nObama made a new fiscal offer Monday which lowered his demand on tax revenues increase further to 1.2 trillion dollars and called on lifting the debt limit for two years.\n\n\n\nThe latest proposal the White House offered was essentially 1.3 trillion dollars in new tax revenue and 850 billion dollars in net spending cuts, Boehner said. "That\'s not balanced in my opinion," he added.\n\n\n\nAs a step to break the budget impasse, Boehner offered Obama a plan last week, which includes letting tax rates rise for those who make over 1 million U.S. dollars a year, contingent upon entitlement spending cuts. The proposal calls for 1 trillion dollars in new tax revenue, more than the 800 billion dollars fresh tax revenue he initially offered.\n\n\n\nAlthough differences remain, progress has been made in recent days as both sides made concessions on their long-held positions.\n\n\n\nWithout a deal from the Congress, all of the Bush-era tax rates will expire at the end of the year, and automatic spending cuts are set to be triggered. Economists have warned that the combination of tax hikes and spending cuts could tip the U.S. economy into recession. \n\n\n\n',

However, will greater U.S. involvement bring peace to Syria? \n\n\n\nSince the beginning of the Syrian crisis, Gulf countries, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have been the main source of weapons for Syrian rebels. There is something fishy about their arms transactions given the close relations between these countries and the United States. \n\n\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times, the United States has promised to provide weapons to Syrian rebels secretly through its Middle Eastern allies. \n\n\n\nMore weapons, more bloodshed \n\n\n\nMore worryingly, the United States labeled a key Syrian rebel group, \u201cJabhat al-Nusra,\u201d as a terrorist organization, while recognizing the legitimacy of the NCSROF, which includes \u201cJabhat al-Nusra.\u201d Furthermore, it has asked the coalition to send a delegation to Washington as soon as possible. \n\n\n\nThe United States has committed dreadful crimes in the Middle East. \n\n\n\nThe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan cost the United States nearly 1 trillion U.S. dollars and the lives of thousands of U.S. soldiers. Despite such a heavy loss, the two countries remain plagued by armed conflict and frequent terrorist attacks. \n\n\n\nFrom \u201cno-fly zone\u201d to \u201cmassive bombing,\u201d the United States played a crucial role in toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's regime. Afterward, it left right away, without considering the sharp internal contradictions in the makeshift opposition alliance. At present, the United States is testing its new Middle East policy in Syria, and plunging the region into greater turmoil. In the eyes of Washington, it is not enough to just destabilize the Middle East. It has gradually shifted attention to the Asia-Pacific region in recent years, and made great efforts to sow discord among regional powers. As a result, the harmony of the region has been brutally devastated. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

The specialists of the Chinese language are becoming increasingly popular in Kazakhstan, and Kazakh people have growing interest in studying Chinese as specialists of Chinese language are in high demand in local labor market.\n\n\n\nThe first group of Chinese language students in the Faculty of Philology of the Eurasian National University named after LN Gumilev Kazakhstan will graduate in two years. "We believe these students have a bright future," said Sholpan Zharkynbekova, dean of the Philological Faculty in an interview with Chinese reporters. \n\n\n\nAccording to Sholpan Zharkynbekova, the L.N.Gumilyov Eurasian National University has 16,000 students studying in 12 institutes and faculties. Faculty of Philology which mainly trains specialists in the field of languages and literature is the largest in scale. \n\n\n\nPreviously this faculty focused on the training of specialists in English, French, German and Italian. Due to the growing demand for professionals in the Chinese language in society, the university opened a Chinese major in philological faculty in 2010. More than 40 students are studying Chinese. \n\n\n\nSholpan Zharkynbekov is confident that the first group of students studying Chinese language at the Faculty of Philology will find a job with ease after two years. She believes that the ministries and Sino-Kazakh joint venture companies can be the appropriate employment for these students.\n\n\n\nDuken Masimhanuly, head of Chinese Philology Department of the L.N.Gumilyov Eurasian National University, a member of the National Council of the President of Kazakhstan, noted that in the near future Philological Faculty will open Chinese language experience center, with the tremendous support of the Embassy of China in Kazakhstan. The new center will provide more opportunities to obtain information about Chinese language and China for students.\n\n',

 'text_content': u'WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- The latest shooting rampage in the U.S. state of Connecticut, in which 20 schoolchildren were cold-bloodedly gunned down on Friday, has rekindled the nation\'s debate on gun control. But it remains to be seen if this horrific incident could change the trajectory of the debate and lead to tangible results.\n\n\n\nBLOODY YEAR OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n\n\nThe United States in 2012 saw more than a dozen mass shootings leading to nearly 100 deaths, experiencing a bloody year that has destroyed families and left survivors with scars that may never heal.\n\n\n\nIn the latest mass killing and one of the worst in U.S. history, a gunman on Friday entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut and went on a shooting spree, killing 20 children aged six or seven and six adults.\n\n\n\nThe shooter, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, killed his mother before driving to the school to carry out the shooting rampage. He sprayed two classrooms with bullets and ultimately turned the gun on himself. All 26 victims were reportedly shot more than once, and some as many as 11 times.\n\n\n\nThis incident came just months after a massacre at a movie theater in the western state of Colorado, during which a shooter fired continuously into a crowd of movie-goers at a midnight screening of the new Batman movie, killing 12 and wounding 70.\n\n\n\nIn another high-profile mass shooting in August, a white supremacist shot and killed six people at a Sikh temple outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin before killing himself.\n\n\n\nOther major shootings this year included an August incident in which three people including a police officer were killed at Texas A&M University by a 35-year-old man. In April, a former student at Oikos University in Oakland, California gunned down seven people in an execution-style killing.\n\n\n\nCALLS FOR TOUGHER GUN CONTROL\n\n\n\nAmid frequent mass shootings this year, many Americans seem to have difficulty recalling each and every incident, and discussions about how to combat gun violence in the country have tended to fizzle out within a week following each massacre.\n\n\n\nBut this time it may be different, said some experts, stressing the fact that the bulk of victims in Friday\'s shooting were children of age 7 or younger.\n\n\n\n"The large number of people killed plus the deaths of 20 very young children puts a human face on this subject that we really haven\'t had before," said Darrell M. West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\n\nIn the past, Democrats have been apprehensive on the issue of gun control, fearing that they may lose the support of some core constituents. "Democrats have been afraid to touch the gun issue for fear it will cost them rural votes. That may change this time around," West told Xinhua.\n\n\n\nIndeed, calls for increased gun legislation have grown louder in the immediate wake of the Connecticut killings. President Barack Obama, visibly shocked by the incident, said on Friday that "meaningful action" should be taken "to prevent more tragedies like this regardless of the politics."\n\n\n\nAppearing on Sunday on NBC\'s "Meet the Press," California Senator Dianne Feinstein said that she plans to reintroduce a bill that limits the possession, sale and transfer of assault weapons as well as high-capacity magazines.\n\n\n\nOutspoken gun control advocate New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on the same show that tackling the issue should top President Obama\'s agenda.\n\n\n\nDan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said on Friday: "In the name of the ... children and teens that die from guns every day in our nation ... we have to take terrible moments like this and use it as a catalyst to demand the sensible change in our nation that is too long overdue."\n\n\n\nBut gun owners\' rights groups such as the National Rifle Association are expected to put up a fight against any measures they deem unfair.\n\n\n\nGun owners have long made the argument that too much gun legislation leaves more firearms in the hands of criminals -- criminals tend to obtain firearms illegally -- and deprives law- abiding citizens of the ability to defend themselves against robberies, home invasions, rape, murder and a host of other crimes.\n\n\n\nSome gun owners\' rights advocates also argue that mass killings tend to occur in places where guns are banned, such as movie theaters and shopping malls, giving mass shooters free rein to kill at will without the fear of getting shot themselves. \n\n\n\n',

 'text_content': u'The launch of Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite by the DPRK is but a "routine move" that highlights the security plight on the Korean Peninsula. The DPRK already launched a satellite earlier this year while South Korea and the United States enhanced their ballistic missile range and load, making security situation on the Korean Peninsula more fragile. \n\n\n\nThose concerned about the situation on the Korean Peninsula understand that here never lacks the impetus for "change". Even if these many changes are not enough to break the general pattern for the moment, there are always opportunities to "take the initiative" in the subtle evolution process. \n\n\n\nSecurity pattern built on the "strategic mutual doubt" and the "strategy of confrontation" is bound to be unsustainable. The seemingly most stable "nuclear balance of power" cannot deter a cold war of bipolar confrontation. Korean Peninsula is overwhelmed by a vicious cycle, which is the basic national recognition to explore the security situation on the Peninsula. China supports solution of the problem through dialogue and consultation, and opposes any behavior that could lead to tensions, and firmly opposes any armed conflict.\n\n\n\nSuch stance embodies the due responsibility as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, embodies the due concerns about Korean Peninsula as a close neighbor, and also emphasizes the unbearable vicious cycle in the Peninsula. Having grasped these points, it is easy to understand China\u2019s stand on the DPRK\u2019s launch of Kwangmyongsong-3: It has the right to the peaceful use of space as well as the obligation to comply with the relevant resolutions of the U.N. Security Council; the Security Council needs to be careful and prudent in carrying out related reactions.\n\n\n\nSubtle, complex, and dangerous, these are the key words in describing the evolution history of the security situation on the Korean Peninsula. The reasonable voice warns people that in the critical moment one should remain calm and restrained.\n\n\n\nPrevention of the deterioration of the security situation requires solution of the problem in a comprehensive and systematic manner. The achievement of denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula, normalization of relations between the countries concerned, and establishment of a peace and security mechanism in Northeast Asia are important aspects in creating peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. \n\n\n\nWhenever the security situation on the Korean peninsula suffers a severe blow, China always emphasizes this point and appeals to restart the six-party talks as soon as possible. China hopes that the parties concerned can calm down and understand its earnest intention and profound meaning.\n\n',
