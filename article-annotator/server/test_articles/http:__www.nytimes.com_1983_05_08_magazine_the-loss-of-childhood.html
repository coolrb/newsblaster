    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  ONCE UPON A TIME, AND NOT SO LONG AGO, the second Sunday in May celebrated a very different image of women and motherhood from the one that prevails today. When today's parents were children, Mother's Day still honored a domesticated little woman waiting with milk and cookies after school, a mother as unlikely to become a single parent during the course of her children's childhood as to become a coal miner.   That bygone era set store by a very different image of children and childhood as well. Children, at least until they reached the ''terrible teens,'' were seen as innocent, playful, childlike creatures in need of special protection, and parents were fiercely determined to keep childhood a carefree Golden Age.   Today, in a time when nearly two-thirds of all mothers with children over 6 have left home for the workplace -some even for the mines - in a time when one out of two marriages ends in divorce, something is decidedly different about children as well.">

                    Today, in a time when nearly two-thirds of all mothers with children over 6 have left home for the workplace -some even for the mines - in a time when one out of two marriages ends in divorce, something is decidedly different about children as well.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In their everyday demeanor, the language they use, the things they know and above all in their relations with the adult world, children have changed. This was confirmed in almost every one of hundreds of interviews with fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh graders. The ease and aplomb these children demonstrated in their talks with an interviewer were quite as indicative of change as anything they actually said, although some of their testimony about marijuana, sex and pornographic movies on cable television would have deeply shocked parents a decade or two ago. The reticence and shyness once associated with childhood have clearly gone the way of curtsies and pinafores. As a Denver fourth-grade teacher reports, ''Kids are a lot freer now. Even in the 10 years I've been at this school, there's been a change. The other day, a very innocent-looking little boy came up to me and casually asked me whether a certain sexual act was 'for real.' He used a crude word for it. I asked him to whisper in my ear what he thought the word meant. Well, he knew more details than I myself knew until about five years ago.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The greatest change of all, however, is not that children have lost their innocence. (An article on that subject, ''What Became of Childhood Innocence?'' by Marie Winn, appeared in this magazine Jan.  25, 1981.) It is a change in our conception of childhood itself. We have seen, in an amazingly short span of time, a transformation of society's most fundamental attitudes toward children. Where parents once felt obliged to shelter their children from life's vicissitudes, today, great numbers of them have come to operate according to a new belief: that children must be exposed early to adult experience in order to survive in an increasingly uncontrollable world. The Age of Protection has ended. An Age of Preparation has set in. And children have suffered a loss. As they are integrated at a young age into the adult world, in every way their lives have become more difficult, more confusing - in short, more like adult lives.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    We are beginning to hear a bitter reaction from that first generation of children to grow up in the new era - today's young adults. In a recent issue of a newsmagazine, a college student writes: ''We are the kids who were 'so adult.' ... Our parents expected us to understand their problems and frustrations ... . What we missed was the chance to be childish, immature and unafraid to admit we didn't have it all together.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The Age of Protection did not end because of a deliberate Page 20-21 decision to treat kids in a new way; it ended out of necessity. For children's lives are always a mirror of adult life. The great social upheavals of the late 1960's and early 1970's -the so-called sexual revolution, the drug epidemic, the women's movement, the breakdown of the conventional two-parent family, the spread of psychoanalytic thinking and the proliferation of television - each of these created changes in adult life that necessitated new ways of dealing with children.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    No one of these changes alone could have brought about the emergence of a brave new relationship between adults and children. It was the confluence of these factors in the beginning of the 1970's that swiftly altered children's lives. Only with the rise in twocareer families and with the mounting divorce rate did parents have cause to withdraw their close attention from children and reduce the careful supervision that had once made the very possibility of sixth graders drinking or smoking marijuana unthinkable. Only with the help of television was the actual decrease in supervision made possible: With the kids sedated into reliable passivity, parents could more easily pursue their own imperatives. Only as the fatalistic principles of Freudian psychology became part of every adult's general knowledge did parents' confidence in their basic ability to supervise their school-age children begin to fail them.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    And yet a decline in supervision is not the entire story. Even in the 1950's, there were undersupervised schoolchildren, who nevertheless did not ''go all the way'' or smoke anything more than an experimental Lucky Strike. The difference is that, in those days before ''The Joy of Sex'' and X-rated movies, sex was still in the closet and drugs were unavailable outside the lower reaches of society. It took a combination of unsupervised children and a permissive, highly charged sexual atmosphere and an influx of easily acquired drugs and the wherewithal to buy them to bring about, by the mid-1970's, precocious experimentation by younger and younger children.        </p>
