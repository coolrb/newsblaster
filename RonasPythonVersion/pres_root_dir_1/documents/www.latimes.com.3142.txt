Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple just to name a few have much, much more data on individuals and what they do than the government does and they sell that data.

This is data, personal data that the idiots opposed to this program have freely given these companies.

You can have a phony Facebook account, with an anonymous email address tied to it, phony everything and Facebook can figure out your real name, street address and phone number from it. If you think I'm joking, think again.

To my knowledge there are no restrictions on who they sell that data to. They could be selling it to the United States government or they could be selling it to a front company for a foreign government or they could and do sell it to other companies such as collection agencies and marketing companies.

If the LA Times isn't selling data on you like most internet operations, then no wonder they're losing money. You can bet Fox News website sells the data they accumulate on you as does MSNBC. Any smart internet company is going to do this if they want to maximize profits.

It's legal, totally legal for them to do this. It's not right but it's legal.

People seem to have no problem turning over their most personal information to a corporation but when the government looks at metadata that nobody owns, they throw a hissy fit.

More than a bit of stupid hypocrisy going on here...
