newsblaster
===========

Group workspace for improvements to the Columbia Newsblaster system.

To run the Article Annotator:

  - cd into article-annotator/
  - run the script (bash run.sh)
  - point your browser to localhost:8000
  - click choose article button in the right sidebar
  - your article will load and stylesheets/javascript will be disabled. 
  	- If not, there is a "Remove Stylesheets" button that you can press
  - When finished, download the finished annotation by clicking "Download Annotated HTML" and pressing save. 
  - If you'd like to annotate another document, simply click "Choose File" again and the annotator will reset.

  * If you've mistakenly annotated a node, simply click it again to remove the annotation. This is somewhat buggy, in the process of fixing it now.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me!
