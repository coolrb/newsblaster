All right, I am officially suspicious of all the sunshine and optimism being spread around that an agreement is fast approaching.

Maybe it's the overcast weather in Seattle Tuesday. Could be that I'm too cynical for my own good. Or it could be that all these reports of an agreement that could be ratified next week are in fact, themselves, a negotiating tactic.

And it very much appears that it's the owners who are perpetrating the signs that an agreement is close.

"No reason to believe it won't get done," an NFL owner said to an ESPN reporter over the weekend.

Notice that's not saying it will get done, either.

The league will also be combatting an image problem if training camps are delayed and the schedule affected because this isn't a strike. It's a lockout. The owners were the ones who instigated this, something the players made clear when the lockout first began. They wanted to keep playing. They wanted to show up for work. It was the teams who kept the doors shut. That was true with some teams the day after a judge ordered the lockout enjoined.

These reports of a deal getting close have the dual effect of not only putting pressure on both sides to get a deal done, but if there isn't an agreement, the owners could be thinking it will shift some of the public blame toward the players.

And maybe there will be an agreement and all this will be moot, but color me suspicious that we're actually on the brink of labor peace in the NFL.
